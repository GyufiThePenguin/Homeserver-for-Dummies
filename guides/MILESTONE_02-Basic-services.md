# Milestone 02 - Basic Services üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to Milestone 02 of your "Home Server for Dummies" journey! You've made it past the initial setup and installation phase, and now it's time to explore the world of basic services that can turn your humble Raspberry Pi or Ubuntu server into a versatile powerhouse. But wait, you might be wondering why this milestone looks a bit like a fruit salad ‚Äì that's because we're about to mix apples and oranges! Don't worry, it's not a culinary experiment but a tech one, and it makes perfect sense.

You see, both Raspberry Pi and Ubuntu are Debian-based systems. It's like discovering that apples and oranges are actually cousins ‚Äì they share a common lineage, and that lineage is Debian. So, we're merging these tutorials not because they're similar (because they're not, just like apples and oranges), but because they both happen to be fruit... I mean, Debian-based systems! 

From this point onward, the tutorials will largely be the same for both Raspberry Pi and Ubuntu, thanks to their shared Debian heritage. However, when there are differences, we'll be sure to highlight them. So, think of it as a tasty fruit salad where apples and oranges coexist harmoniously, with the occasional sprinkle of uniqueness.
