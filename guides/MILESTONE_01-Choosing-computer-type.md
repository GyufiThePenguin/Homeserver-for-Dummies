# Lets Begin. What to use?

So, you have many options here. First off, let me tell you, that we are ganna use Linux based operating systems. They are light weight, meaning they will not use up your resources and generally they have more capabilities than Windows server (for example ZFS). Now, lets's see the options:



## Raspberry Pi üçì

A Raspberry Pi is a small, affordable, and energy-efficient computer that can be used as a home server.

**What It Is:**
- A credit card-sized computer running Linux-based operating systems.
- It's ideal for lightweight server tasks like file storage, web hosting, and more.

**What It Can Do:**
- Host personal websites and blogs.
- Set up a file server for sharing and storing files.
- Run lightweight server applications like a media server.
- Educate yourself in server management and programming.

**What It Can't Do:**
- Handle resource-intensive tasks like video editing or gaming.
- Serve as a replacement for a high-end dedicated server.

**Price:**
- Raspberry Pi boards are relatively inexpensive, with various models available at different price points. The total cost depends on the model and additional accessories you choose.
- Additinally, you may want to invest in external storage, as the PI uses an SD card as storage. 

## PC / Laptop üñ•Ô∏è

Using a PC or Laptop as your home server provides more power and flexibility.

**What It Is:**
- A standard personal computer or laptop running a Linux-based operating system.
- It offers more processing power and storage capacity compared to Raspberry Pi.

**What It Can Do:**
- Host personal websites and blogs.
- Set up a file server, media server, or game server.
- Handle resource-intensive tasks like virtualization.
- Serve as a versatile home server solution.

**What It Can't Do:**
- Achieve the same energy efficiency as a Raspberry Pi.
- Match the low cost of a Raspberry Pi setup.

**Price:**
- The cost depends on the PC or Laptop you choose, but it typically exceeds that of a Raspberry Pi. However, you gain more processing power and capabilities in return.



## Other Options üì¶

In addition to Raspberry Pi and PC/Laptop solutions, there are other alternatives worth considering for your home server needs. These options offer specific features and capabilities, but please note that this tutorial does not cover them in detail due to my limited experience with them. However, contributions and external resources are welcomed.

### Pre-Built NAS Systems (e.g., Synology) ‚òÅÔ∏è

**What It Is:**
- Pre-built network-attached storage (NAS) systems designed for data storage and sharing.
- Typically, they come with user-friendly interfaces and a wide range of applications for various purposes.

**What It Can Do:**
- Efficiently store and manage files, photos, and media.
- Offer backup and synchronization solutions.
- Run some server applications.

**What It Can't Do:**
- Full customization and flexibility compared to DIY solutions.
- May not be cost-effective for specific server tasks.

### Dedicated Server Operating Systems (e.g., Unraid, TrueNAS, Open Media Server) üìÄ

**What It Is:**
- Specialized operating systems designed for server and storage applications.
- Offer features like data redundancy, virtualization, and container support.

**What It Can Do:**
- Manage multiple services and applications on a single machine.
- Provide advanced data management and security features.

**What It Can't Do:**
- May have a steeper learning curve for beginners.
- May require specific hardware configurations.

Please keep in mind that this tutorial primarily focuses on Raspberry Pi and PC/Laptop setups. If you have experience with or wish to explore pre-built NAS systems or dedicated server operating systems, you are encouraged to do so. Contributions, additional resources, or community discussions related to these options are welcomed, and they can be beneficial for those interested in pursuing them for their home server needs.

# Now that you know this, you have the following choises:
- I already have an installed Raspberry Pi -> In that case, you can skip a few steps, go to [Milestone 02 - First Steps](./MILESTONE_02-First-steps.md)
- I have an unused PC/Laptop and already have Ubuntu (or other Debian based OS) installed -> Great, go to [Milestone 02 - First Steps](./MILESTONE_02-First-steps.md)
- I have a Raspberry PI, but nothing, not even the operating system is installed -> No worries, follow [How to install Raspbian](./01_How-to-install-raspbian.md)
- I have an unused PC/Laptop. -> Awesome, please follow [How to install Ubuntu](./01_How-to-install-ubuntu.md)
