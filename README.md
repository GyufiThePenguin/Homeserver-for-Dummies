# Home Server for Dummies 🏡💻

Welcome to the "Home Server for Dummies" repository! This project aims to provide a beginner-friendly guide to setting up and maintaining a home server, making the process accessible to users with little to no prior experience.

## Introduction 🚀

A home server can serve as a powerful tool for hosting personal websites, storing and hosting files, or even running applications. This guide is tailored to those who are new to the concept of home servers and wish to get started with confidence.

In this tutorial, I will guide you through installing the OS, configuring the base system, and adding services, like local file share, a media server (your own Netflix), DNS filtering, and more. If some of that sounds alien, don't worry; it will be explained later.

This guide works like a choose-your-adventure game; you don't have to open countless browser pages—just follow the links that match your situation. For example, the structure is the following:

- STEP1 -> STEP2 -> STEP3 -> STEP4

In STEP1, I will ask a question: Do you have xy?
- If no, then click on the appropriate link, which will take you to STEP2, explain what it is, how to get/install it, and then point you to STEP3.
- If yes, the guide will point you to STEP3, skipping STEP2 as you already have it.
